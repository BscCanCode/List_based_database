# Simulated Database Operations using Lists
A basic Python application to simulate database operations (insert, read, update, delete) using a list, created by [Sid.py] on April 2025.

## Purpose
This Simulated Database App allows users to manage a list as a database, serving as a learning project to practice Python list operations, user input handling, and basic error management.

## How to Run
1. Clone the reposi

## Features
- **Insert Elements**: Add a number to the database list.
- **Read Elements**: Display all elements in the database (with empty check).
- **Update Elements**: Replace an existing element with a new one.
- **Delete Database**: Remove the entire database.
- **Delete Elements**: Clear all elements from the database.
- **Exit**: Safely end the application.

  ## Errors
  - There are might be few errors in my code but still keeping it raw for my understanding as this what i understood and implemented, as my understanding will grow,errors will be reduced.

## Usage Example
1. Run `python database_sim.py`.
2. Choose `1` to insert, enter `10` (e.g., "Element added successfully" and [10] shown).
3. Choose `1` to insert, enter `20` (e.g., [10, 20] shown).
4. Choose `2` to read (e.g., [10, 20] shown).
5. Choose `3` to update, enter `10`, then `15` (e.g., [20, 15] shown).
6. Choose `5` to delete elements, confirm "yes" (e.g., [] shown).
7. Choose `4` to delete database, confirm "yes" (note: may crash after this).
8. Choose `6` to exit.

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (while loops, lists, `try-except` for error handling).

## NOTE
- This README is created with help from an AI chatbot.
- I know it has some errors, but it runs too, the reason I kept it as it is: because I want to show people what I understood and develop a code according to my understanding, as my logic and understanding will develop I may or may not update the code.

## Fun_Fact
- I coded this mini-database in a few minutes!
